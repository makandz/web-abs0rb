# web-abs0rb

Archive site for **Abs0rb.me**, published after the original game was taken offline.

Abs0rb.me is now offline, this project exists to preserve a nostalgic snapshot of the game with historical stats, leaderboards, and fun memories pulled from the old database and exported as static JSON.

This entire website was generated with the help of AI. Had to get something shipped out as soon as possible 😛
